# When uploading packages to the registry Scarb will automatically
# "normalize" Scarb.toml files for maximal compatibility
# with all versions of Scarb and also rewrite `path` dependencies
# to registry dependencies.
#
# If you are reading this file be aware that the original Scarb.toml
# will likely look very different (and much more reasonable).
# See Scarb.orig.toml for the original contents.
