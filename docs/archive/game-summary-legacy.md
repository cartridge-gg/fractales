# Vision

Realms: Adventurers is more than just a game—it's a living, persistent world designed to exist and grow for decades, regardless of who is playing or what technology is popular. By putting all core rules, state, and ownership on-chain, the world becomes truly open and independent: no single company or server can ever shut it down. Anyone, at any time, can build new interfaces, create new stories, or rediscover lost territories. Even five, ten, or fifty years from now, the world will still be there, ready for new explorers, builders, and dreamers to make it their own. This is a game that can never die, because it belongs to everyone.

## A Day in the Life

I wake up and check in on my team of adventurers. Overnight, my mining specialist finished extracting ore from a mountain hex, while my botanist harvested rare plants in a distant forest. I review their progress and decide where to send them next—should I risk exploring an unexplored swamp, or focus on developing my newly claimed territory?

I allocate energy to my adventurers, making sure I have enough reserves to maintain my properties and prevent them from decaying. I notice that one of my territories is close to the decay threshold, so I invest some energy to keep it safe from takeover. I set new access rules for my mining site, adjusting the fees for other players who want to use it, and check if anyone has paid to harvest resources while I was away.

Throughout the day, I interact with other players—sometimes trading resources, sometimes negotiating alliances, and sometimes competing for control of valuable hexes. I experiment with new strategies, programming my adventurers to act autonomously when I’m offline. The world keeps moving, with new areas being discovered and the economy shifting as players make decisions. Every action I take leaves a mark on the world, and I know that even if I step away, my adventurers and territories will persist, ready for the next chapter of my story whenever I return.

# Realms: Adventurers – Game Summary

Realms: Adventurers is an online game set in a procedurally generated, infinite hex-grid world. Players manage a team of autonomous adventurers who explore, harvest resources, mine, craft items, and build infrastructure. The world is shaped by player discovery—when a player is the first to uncover a new area, they receive a unique ownership NFT, granting them control over access, pricing, and revenue from that territory. This system encourages exploration and creates a dynamic property market where territories can be developed, traded, or lost if not maintained.

The game’s economy is deeply integrated with its world systems. All resources, from plants to ores, can be converted into energy, which is required for actions and territory upkeep. Territories and buildings consume energy over time, and neglect leads to decay, making them vulnerable to takeover by other players. Players can program custom business logic and permissions for their owned areas, enabling a wide range of economic models—from simple access fees to complex guilds, auctions, and insurance systems. This flexibility allows for emergent strategies and player-driven economic innovation.

Gameplay emphasizes strategic management and long-term planning. Adventurers improve their skills through use, and their actions are often time-locked, requiring players to balance risk, reward, and resource allocation. The world is persistent and player-driven, with no central authority altering the rules. All core mechanics are implemented in smart contracts, ensuring transparency and fairness. The result is a living, evolving world where exploration, economic strategy, and social cooperation are at the heart of the experience.

## Key Systems Overview

### Energy System

Energy is the core resource that powers all actions in the game, from moving and harvesting to maintaining territories and buildings. Every activity consumes energy, and players must manage their reserves carefully. If a territory or building is neglected and runs out of energy, it begins to decay and can eventually be claimed by others. This creates a natural limit on expansion and encourages active management.

### Ownership System

When a player is the first to discover a new area—such as a mine, harvest site, or ruin—they receive a digital ownership token (NFT) for that location. This token gives them the right to set rules, charge fees, and collect revenue from anyone who wants to use or access their discovery. Ownership can be traded or lost if the area is not properly maintained, making property rights both valuable and dynamic.

### Procedural System

The world is generated using procedural algorithms, meaning every hex, resource, and area is created on the fly based on deterministic rules and randomness. This ensures that the world is effectively infinite and unique for every player, while still being fair and consistent. Players can only discover new areas by exploring adjacent spaces, making exploration a core part of the gameplay experience.

## The World Algorithm

At the heart of Realms: Adventurers is the World Algorithm—a procedural generation system that elegantly balances randomness and order. Every hex, resource, and area in the world is created using deterministic rules combined with random seeds, ensuring that each discovery is unique but remains consistent for all players. This means that when you find a hidden valley or a rare mineral vein, it will always exist in that location for everyone, but no one can predict what lies beyond the next unexplored hex.

The World Algorithm creates a sense of endless possibility. The map is infinite, yet coherent: biomes cluster naturally, resources are distributed fairly, and every new area feels like a logical extension of the world. This approach allows for emergent gameplay, where players can specialize, trade, and strategize based on the ever-evolving landscape. The result is a world that is always fresh, always fair, and always ready for new stories to unfold.

## The World Map

The game world is structured as an infinite hexagonal grid, with each hex representing a unique location such as a forest, mountain, desert, or city. Players begin at the center and can move to adjacent hexes, revealing new terrain as they go. The map is procedurally generated, so every new area is a surprise, but once discovered, its features remain consistent for all players. This design encourages exploration and ensures that the world always has new frontiers to uncover.

## Example Gameplay Loop

1. **Start Your Journey:** You begin with a team of adventurers at the center of the map, each with basic equipment and energy.
2. **Explore Nearby Hexes:** Move your adventurers to adjacent hexes, spending energy to reveal new biomes and potential resources.
3. **Discover and Claim:** When you are the first to discover a special area (like a mine or harvest site), you receive an ownership NFT, giving you control over that location.
4. **Develop Your Territory:** Use your adventurers to harvest resources, mine ores, or build structures on your owned hexes. Set access rules and fees for other players who want to use your territory.
5. **Manage Energy and Upkeep:** Regularly invest energy to maintain your territories and prevent decay. If neglected, your holdings may become vulnerable to takeover by others.
6. **Trade and Cooperate:** Interact with other players by trading resources, forming alliances, or participating in shared economic ventures.
7. **Expand and Specialize:** As your adventurers gain experience and your holdings grow, explore further, develop new skills, and experiment with different economic strategies to build your own unique legacy in the world.

## Visuals and Interface

Realms: Adventurers is a headless game, meaning it does not have built-in graphics or a fixed visual style. Instead, the entire game state and logic live on-chain, making it accessible to any type of client or interface. The game is designed to be AI interface first: players can interact with the world through programmable agents, chatbots, or custom AI-driven dashboards. This flexibility allows the same game to be experienced as a text adventure, a 2D or 3D map, or even through conversational interfaces like Discord bots. The focus is on open, composable access, so anyone can build their own visualizations or tools to interact with the persistent, shared world.
